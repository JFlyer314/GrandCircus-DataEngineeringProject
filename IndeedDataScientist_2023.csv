66,Data Scientist,Ntropy Network,"New York, NY•Remote","$130,000 a year","Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).

As an early member of our data science team, you will help
- push the limits of what can be done with data.
- build the team and drive the direction of the company.
- shape our product and culture.
- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.

The following are required
- the tools: Python, Pandas / Polars, Matplotlib, sklearn, etc.
SQL and fundamental database operations.
- recognized open-source contributions and/or top performance in data competitions (Kaggle, Numerai, etc.).
fluency in statistics and probability.

Leveraging data to solve customer problems is in Hopper’s DNA. While this began with helping customers save money by booking at the best time with our Price Prediction tool, we’ve also used data to build a suite of novel Fintech products that help customers save money while traveling.

You will be focusing on solving data and engineering problems that allow Hopper to offer products that help our customers navigate travel disruptions (like flight delays, cancellations, or missed connections), and ultimately get where they want to be. If a customer experiences a disruption, they can rebook themselves on any airline - right in the Hopper app - for free. The Disruption vertical has grown significantly in the last few years and is expanding more by maturing our core products, entering new travel verticals, and offering our products in completely new distribution channels (outside of the Hopper app).

This role has a tremendous impact on the vision and success of the company. It's a unique opportunity to join one of Hopper's most innovative teams, and get access to fascinating and massive market and behavioral data sets. It’s a huge personal growth opportunity, and includes high potential upside of pre-IPO stock options.

In this role you will be part of a cross-functional team of product managers, designers, and engineers who work closely together to make travel easier and reach millions of users in the process. We are looking for someone who has a real bias for action, takes ownership, thrives on autonomy and delivers results.
Responsibilities:
Identifying high impact user or flight segments; using them to design risk-based pricing models; building and shipping the models; all with the goal of adding value to our customers’ travel experience while increasing gross profit
Think beyond “just the model” by challenging existing product construction and UX, and building data-backed business cases to ship alternatives that improve the customer experience
Find new opportunities for revenue growth by becoming the expert on our data and customers
Ensuring we are priced correctly based on changing demand environments and external conditions
Deliver all of the above within the Hopper app as well as on other distribution channels–the reach of this role is huge
An ideal candidate has:
A proven track record of solving complex problems with in depth understanding of data, product and business impact
Strong creative problem-solving skills and critical thinking competencies
Designed, implemented, and deployed pricing models into production using modern technologies (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform, etc)
Fluency reading and writing coding languages like Python, SQL, etc.
Past success analyzing data, drawing accurate conclusions, and adjusting strategy accordingly
Works backwards from adding value to the customer experience
Experience with data visualization tools (Tableau, Amplitude, Big Query)
Worked on a consumer product and has shipped high impact models at scale
Strong experience, knowledge of, and/or keen interest in Fintech, Insurtech, or risk-based products
Exceptional ability to grasp, manage, and articulate complex systems
Perks of working with us:
Competitive salary commensurate with candidate’s relevant qualifications, knowledge, skills and work experience. Total compensation may also include equity (options / RSUs), sign-on bonus and other potential incentives
Unlimited PTO
WeWork All Access Pass OR Work-from-home stipend

Through this partnership program, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory. As its first Hopper Cloud partnership,

Hopper partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders.

Leveraging data to solve customer problems is in Hopper’s DNA. While this began with helping customers save money by booking at the best time with our Price Prediction tool, we’ve also used data to build a suite of novel Fintech products that help customers save money while traveling.

You will be focusing on solving data and engineering problems that allow Hopper to offer products that help our customers navigate travel disruptions (like flight delays, cancellations, or missed connections), and ultimately get where they want to be. If a customer experiences a disruption, they can rebook themselves on any airline - right in the Hopper app - for free. The Disruption vertical has grown significantly in the last few years and is expanding more by maturing our core products, entering new travel verticals, and offering our products in completely new distribution channels (outside of the Hopper app).

This role has a tremendous impact on the vision and success of the company. It's a unique opportunity to join one of Hopper's most innovative teams, and get access to fascinating and massive market and behavioral data sets.

We are looking for someone who has a real bias for action, takes ownership, thrives on autonomy and delivers results.
Responsibilities:
Identifying high impact user or flight segments; using them to design risk-based pricing models; building and shipping the models; all with the goal of adding value to our customers’ travel experience while increasing gross profit
Think beyond “just the model” by challenging existing product construction and UX, and building data-backed business cases to ship alternatives that improve the customer experience
Find new opportunities for revenue growth by becoming the expert on our data and customers
Ensuring we are priced correctly based on changing demand environments and external conditions
Deliver all of the above within the Hopper app as well as on other distribution channels–the reach of this role is huge
An ideal candidate has:
A proven track record of solving complex problems with in depth understanding of data, product and business impact
Strong creative problem-solving skills and critical thinking competencies
Designed, implemented, and deployed pricing models into production using modern technologies (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform, etc)

Currently, the department has over 165 Faculty members, 25 Staff Physicians, 162 Staff Employees, 11 Fellows, 75 Residents, 21 Non-Faculty Academics, 9 Post Docs, 68 CRNAs and 5 Nurse Practitioners at ZSFG.

In addition to the Moffitt-Long Hospital, very active units of the department exist at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (inpatient and outpatient, including a very active trauma service), San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (inpatient and outpatient), Mt. Zion Medical Center (outpatient, including 23 hour stays and the Pain Management Center), the UCSF Orthopedic Institute and the Benioff Children's, Betty Irene Moore Women's and Bakar Cancer (NIH-designated Cancer Center) Hospitals in the Mission Bay neighborhood.

The Department now has essential roles in patient care outside of the operating rooms, with active participation in Ambulatory Care, Acute and Chronic Pain, and in the Preoperative Clinic. Over the department’s fifty-plus years of existence, the department has been at the heart of modern anesthesia’s explosive growth, and to this day continues to have an enormous impact on surgical practice and the management of pain. The department’s research, education, and clinical care quickly earned and have maintained reputations that are the equal or better of any institution in the world. Individual members of our faculty have had a major influence on our specialty both nationally and internationally, including NIH study sections, NIH funding, FDA and Editorial Boards. Research activities within this department are integrated with and inform clinical practice. For many years, ours has been among the top departments for NIH research funding in anesthesia in the United States.

The Department of Anesthesia provides considerable support and structure for research in general and, for research training programs, highlighted by the innovative Pathway to Scientific Independence (PSI). This program begins at the residency level, incorporating the Research Scholars Track of the Anesthesia Residency, moving through the post-residency NIH-funded T32 training grant, and faculty positions with a mentored research support, and ultimately to achieving extramurally funded, independent researcher status.

The Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care at UCSF provides outstanding patient care, promotes cutting-edge basic and clinical science research, and educates the next generation of health care providers while focusing on increasing diversity, equity and inclusion across the organization.

The Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care ranks as one of the largest departments in the School of Medicine with an annual budget of $114 million. The two largest component of the annual budget are Professional Fee Income and Extramural Funds, representing over $101 million and $9.6 million of the annual budget respectively. Currently, the department has over 165 Faculty members, 25 Staff Physicians, 162 Staff Employees, 11 Fellows, 75 Residents, 21 Non-Faculty Academics, 9 Post Docs, 68 CRNAs and 5 Nurse Practitioners at ZSFG.

In addition to the Moffitt-Long Hospital, very active units of the department exist at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (inpatient and outpatient, including a very active trauma service), San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (inpatient and outpatient), Mt. Zion Medical Center (outpatient, including 23 hour stays and the Pain Management Center), the UCSF Orthopedic Institute and the Benioff Children's, Betty Irene Moore Women's and Bakar Cancer (NIH-designated Cancer Center) Hospitals in the Mission Bay neighborhood.

The Department now has essential roles in patient care outside of the operating rooms, with active participation in Ambulatory Care, Acute and Chronic Pain, and in the Preoperative Clinic. Over the department’s fifty-plus years of existence, the department has been at the heart of modern anesthesia’s explosive growth, and to this day continues to have an enormous impact on surgical practice and the management of pain. The department’s research, education, and clinical care quickly earned and have maintained reputations that are the equal or better of any institution in the world. Individual members of our faculty have had a major influence on our specialty both nationally and internationally, including NIH study sections, NIH funding, FDA and Editorial Boards. Research activities within this department are integrated with and inform clinical practice. For many years, ours has been among the top departments for NIH research funding in anesthesia in the United States.

The Department of Anesthesia provides considerable support and structure for research in general and, for research training programs, highlighted by the innovative Pathway to Scientific Independence (PSI). This program begins at the residency level, incorporating the Research Scholars Track of the Anesthesia Residency, moving through the post-residency NIH-funded T32 training grant, and faculty positions with a mentored research support, and ultimately to achieving extramurally funded, independent researcher status.

236,N,N,N,N,"You’ll be the founding data scientist in a well-funded company looking to define Web 3 user identity and attribution.
We plan on running a lean team: expect to totally own your area of responsibility and use your initiative and judgement to keep your part of Spindl running and growing.
Be comfortable with being uncomfortable. You will be creating the metrics and methodologies that will define an entire industry within Web 3. There won’t be easy answers for most of what we do. We’re already making it up as we go along.
Speed is a feature, in teams, products, and people: keep up with the Spindl pack. There isn’t a moment to lose.
We’re looking for pirates now that Web 2 has become the navy.
Responsibilities
Be a leader within a very flat and fast-moving team
Understand the often weird and hacked-together blockchain world, as well as the embryonic data stack being built on top of it
Navigate the idea maze toward Truth (or something like it)
Plot the critical curve or generate the essential dashboard that helps us understand Web 3.
Creatively address business problems when there are no precedents and no clear answers
Work with engineering to implement your findings and models into running product quickly. You are mapping the unknown terrain; we want to turn that into industry knowledge ASAP.
Empathize with our customers, understand their worldview, and work with the UI team to translate your insights into customer insights.
Convey your findings to colleagues; tell a story with data convincingly. Optionally, publish your work publicly will full credit.
Must haves (this is an AND)
N years doing data science or analysis (for reasonable N).
Proficiency with data visualization and dashboarding tools like Looker or Tableau. Think those suck? Tell us why.
Ideally, this would involve more than just descriptive dashboarding and extend into some predictive model-building around complicated ecosystems like markets or user behavior online.
Experience with modeling in Python: Jupyter, Pandas, PyTorch, numpy, scipy, etc.
Exception to the above: Outstanding familiarity with blockchains and protocols and their often quirky data, along with extensive experience in environments like Dune or Flipside, can compensate for a lack of more traditional data science experience. If you’re the #3 person on the Dune leaderboard, let’s talk.
Be smart and get shit done.
Be a doer and a risk-taker.
Nice to haves (this is an OR)
Experience with advertising technology or campaign management within Web 2 ads
Experience with A/B testing and experimentation
Experience in anti-fraud, either within ad tech or fin tech. There are lots of bad guys to block in Web 3.
Location
You can be located anywhere in the world, but we have a strong preference for SF or NYC. If you’re not in either city, expect some travel to work face-to-face with colleagues on a semi-regular basis. If you’re in one of those cities, you’ll find a balance between coming into the office and not.

Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.

Department Description
The Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care at UCSF provides outstanding patient care, promotes cutting-edge basic and clinical science research, and educates the next generation of health care providers while focusing on increasing diversity, equity and inclusion across the organization.

The Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care ranks as one of the largest departments in the School of Medicine with an annual budget of $114 million. The two largest component of the annual budget are Professional Fee Income and Extramural Funds, representing over $101 million and $9.6 million of the annual budget respectively. Currently, the department has over 165 Faculty members, 25 Staff Physicians, 162 Staff Employees, 11 Fellows, 75 Residents, 21 Non-Faculty Academics, 9 Post Docs, 68 CRNAs and 5 Nurse Practitioners at ZSFG.

In addition to the Moffitt-Long Hospital, very active units of the department exist at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (inpatient and outpatient, including a very active trauma service), San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (inpatient and outpatient), Mt. Zion Medical Center (outpatient, including 23 hour stays and the Pain Management Center), the UCSF Orthopedic Institute and the Benioff Children's, Betty Irene Moore Women's and Bakar Cancer (NIH-designated Cancer Center) Hospitals in the Mission Bay neighborhood.

The Department now has essential roles in patient care outside of the operating rooms, with active participation in Ambulatory Care, Acute and Chronic Pain, and in the Preoperative Clinic. Over the department’s fifty-plus years of existence, the department has been at the heart of modern anesthesia’s explosive growth, and to this day continues to have an enormous impact on surgical practice and the management of pain. The department’s research, education, and clinical care quickly earned and have maintained reputations that are the equal or better of any institution in the world.

407,Data Scientist [NYC],CarbonChain,"New York, NY•Hybrid remote",N,"Do you want to work on the most pressing problem of our generation?
We're building the infrastructure for the net zero transition, and we're looking for brilliant builders who want to help define a low carbon future.
Decarbonizing the economy requires a granular, real-time view of where emissions come from and how they might be reduced. We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. Having developed technology which is significant in advance of competitive solutions, we are now investing heavily in market adoption.

You can find out more about interviewing at CarbonChain at https://www.carbonchain.com/careers/interview-process.
Working at CarbonChain
To join CarbonChain, you'll be a keen team player who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we've run Amazon's European supply chain, built JustEat's corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We've got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there's a lot we don't know, and we're hoping you can help fill that gap.
We encourage every member of our team to be the best they can be, whether that's developing skills through their learning budget or participating in reading groups. Our work requires everybody to straddle the physical and digital worlds, and a growth mindset is essential.
What will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?
As the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there's a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Scientist is to build the datasets, models, and pipelines we need to provide that understanding, and get insights to clients.
As the first Data Science hire in the NYC office, you'll help form the team in NYC and collaborate closely with London. Your work will directly contribute to the acquisition and success of North American clients, whilst helping to shape the product to meet the needs of a new market.
This is a role that will involve lots of contact with clients and close collaboration with the sales team. We're looking for a commercially-minded data scientist who is curious about discovering and solving customer problems.
You can expect to have:
Ownership of your projects
Extensive client exposure
The ability to make real changes with tangible business value
Our data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers. A typical service might pull together a mix of data from relational and non-relational databases, train a machine learning model nightly, and expose predictions via a Lambda function. We've got a huge number of exciting things to build, from interactive visualizations of industrial processes to fluid-dynamics models of shipping emissions.
Our only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology and the ability to build close relationships with your team.
Which tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?
Data processing with the standard scientific stack (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy) and beyond
Machine learning in Sklearn and (rarely) Pytorch
Data visualization with Plotly, Maptlotlib, and Altair
Containerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will.
Object-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase.
PostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you'll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds.
Infrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond).
Testing approaches from unit testing to integration testing are key to delivering reliable and maintainable solutions.
Quality assurance is owned by the team themselves - we believe that full cycle product ownership should sit tightly within the team.
Agile development, using various approaches from Scrum to Elephant Carpaccio, helps us deliver software in small iterations, learning and course-correcting in the process to make sure we deliver the right improvements.
GitHub PRs are an integral part of our core development flow - with reviews to help share knowledge and improve quality.
Continuous delivery is the approach we strive for - with metrics that help us optimise parts of the pipeline that need it the most.
Teamwork and collaboration are fundamental to the delivery of our solutions. We encourage solutionizing between the team and the wider business.
You don't need to be a pro at all of these skills to apply for the role, but we'd love to hear about any relevant knowledge and experiences that you have in these areas.
What we require from applicants
Right to work in the US and willingness to come to the NYC office 2+ days a week
4+ years of relevant work experience
A passion for environmental issues
A demonstrated interest in building products and collaborating tightly with engineers
The grit and energy to work in an early stage startup
What we're offering
Healthcare
Competitive salary + generous equity package
Flexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeing
$2,000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new things
Tech equipment of your choice
Regular social activities
Generous amount of holidays, 26 days of annual leave
We're striving to build a diverse team and we would love to hear from applicants from backgrounds less frequently represented in technology, be that in terms of gender, race, or professional background.

Kontakt.io Virtues and Culture
Lead customer-centric - customer leadership is the key. If a customer has a problem we don’t wait. We understand what customer needs and we tailor our services, products around the customer. It doesn’t mean that we let the customer lead us. It means that we think about the customer first

Have a growth mindset - we commit to results and growth. We are responsible for results, not for the activity or time spent. If we believe we can’t achieve a result or a job, it’s our duty to raise the voice, push back, explain what we suggest instead. We don’t see results as something static - ever. This means that our results and expectations are becoming more ambitious, quarter over quarter. We constantly evolve

Challenge, inspire, respect - we are the challenger in the marketplace. When working with each other - or with customers - we enjoy and desire to challenge each other. We listen, reflect, and respond. We aim to understand the point of view of the other party and if there is customer merit in the argument. When we challenge, we articulate our hypothesis clearly and provide data and evidence in our argumentation. We respect the time of our colleagues. We have a zero-tolerance towards discrimination of any kind. We respect the environment

Execute systematically - We recognize that the start-up journey will only be successful if we learn twice as much as others in half the time. For us, innovation also means continuous improvement in all fields. We think in systems when driving results, growth, and learnings

Act with urgency - We have a sense of urgency in everything we do - at all times. It’s deeply rooted in the belief that as an up-start, as a challenger, we need to drive value for our customers faster and better than anybody else in the marketplace. We do things outside of the personal comfort zone."

463,Data Scientist (Multiple Levels),Red Alpha LLC,"114 National Business Pkwy, Annapolis Junction, MD 20701",N,"Description:

A little about us:
The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems.
Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed.
Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you.
A day in the life:
You’ll likely start your day at a customer location near our Red Alpha offices, checking to see if there are any important items that have just come up. If not, you’ll move on to improving a dashboard or other data product that you’re responsible for, or perhaps produce a weekly output the customer is expecting. You’ll be using R or Python a lot, but also Git, Mongo, some commercial software and several other usual suspects. Once a week you’ll attend a team meeting (with 4 others) to prioritize things, and you’ll have a lot of interaction with the team otherwise, typically several times per day. You’ll need your sense of humor and need to be willing to leave your ego at the door.
Requirements:

What you bring to the table:
Now on to the fun of formal requirements - we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in.
All of our data scientists need the following skills:
Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python
Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list.
A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field.
For entry-level data scientists, 0-3 years of experience on Data Science projects.
For mid-level data scientists, 3-6 years of experience on Data Science projects.
For senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams.
A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance.
These are important skills to have, but not necessarily mandatory:
Exceptional interpersonal skills. You know, as in you might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues.
Experience with Java, C, or other compiled languages
Comprehensive knowledge of Saturday Night Live sketches (just kidding)
Experience with SQL/NoSQL, Spark, Hadoop
Familiarity with Javascript and Scripting
Familiarity with Docker, GitLab, and React
Why Red Alpha?
Every day, our elite customers are pushing through ""the grind"" to defeat the enemy, even putting their lives on the line for our freedom. Rise to the occasion with us to deliver engineering excellence, to match their dedication to this nation. Join us as we bring digital transformation to the fight.
Some of our perks and benefits:
You can retire sooner rather than planned: Get closer to retirement with up to 12% in 401k contributions.
You can have a career AND a life: Enjoy up to 5 weeks of leave (25 days of personal time off) and 11 paid holidays (all of which we treat as floaters).
You can stay at your best: As a member, we'll pay 100% of your premiums for comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance. We'll also pay the majority of the premiums for your family.

What We're Looking For In Teammates
Technology like what we're building doesn't happen on its own. It is the result of a collaborative environment and the hard work of passionate, dedicated individuals working intelligently towards a common goal. We are looking for exceptional people to join our growing team and have a positive impact on our culture, technology, and product from day one. We deeply value humility, curiosity, and a positive attitude and you should as well. You should also believe that mutual respect is the foundation of any healthy and productive relationship. You should be unafraid to ask questions or challenge responses no matter how simple or complex. Most importantly, you should value honest and direct communication as you recognize that this is the best way for any individual or team to continuously learn and grow. Accomplishing our collective goals will be fun but it will also be hard; you should be in pursuit of an ongoing and rewarding challenge!
What It's Like To Work With Us
We're passionate about the technology we've created and what we're building, but we know that changing any industry and creating a successful company will take balance, maturity, and a sustained effort. We've combined retail industry expertise, amazing engineers with experience shipping real-world hardware and software solutions, and a team of brilliant minds who are not afraid to focus on solving ""impossible"" problems. But this passion doesn't mean we live unbalanced lives. We have families and passions outside of work, and we know that the best work comes from sharp, rested people. We respect each other and each of our contributions, and we believe that the best solutions will come from a diversity of ideas and perspectives.
Finally, we build our products with deep empathy for the people who will use them every day. Their input and insights are our clearest guide to building what they need; we respect our partners and clients, and listen closely to their feedback."

669,Data Scientist,AE Studio,"Los Angeles, CA•Remote","$120,000 - $220,000 a year","AE Studio is an LA-based company focused on increasing human agency while maintaining our ineffable culture and whimsy. If the work diminishes agency, we may simply decide to “eff” it after all. In our Venice CA office and our respective domiciles live a team of highly-skilled developers, data scientists, and dubiously-lucid humorists building agency-increasing products you may recall from such sentences as the one in this paragraph. We’ve worked with Samsung, Walmart, Berkshire Hathaway, and other large, important entities you’ve probably heard of. Our work environment is fantastic for aspiring coders, calculators, and entrepreneurs. Also, we have neither VC, nor PE, nor other acronyms funding us. We have a weird business model where we sell our work for a profit and use those profits to pay people (I told you it was weird!).
More specifically, we deploy the proceeds from our consulting work in development and data science to support and incubate internal skunkworks projects (anything interesting you’re working on right now?). The proceeds from those projects (we just sold one!) are used to fund cutting-edge brain-computer-interface (BCI) research - maximizing human agency before some corporate megalomaniacs interrupt our thoughts with advertisements!
Do you have strong problem-solving skills? Do you have a disposition suited for self-management? Have you ever composed a Gilbert and Sullivan parody that would offend Victorian sensibilities? If you can say “yes” to two of those three questions, please !
ABOUT YOU
Fluency in Python–used often, derided occasionally, and considered its eponymous reference to the best of British sketch comedy
Proven data science experience–primary or equal contributor, multiple smaller projects, management of steak-holders (so projects come out ‘well-done’)
Comfort with the statistics and methods deployed in classification problems–that is, the ability to see the random forest for the trees
Familiarity with NLP/NLU–even if this posting’s language is a bit unnatural, we suspect you’ll understand our process
Experience with image classification–pictures are worth ~1,000 lines of code, according to a bastardization of Ibsen and Brisbane
Experience calling machine learning APIs via REST or client libraries - and determining that their responses lack wit, guile, and tact
Agile experience (worked with Kanban, Scrum, Extreme Programming)–or a sound literary understanding of Steve Martin’s “Picasso at the Lapin Agile,” even if you don’t speak French
Growth mindset – You had better be funnier after the first 90 days...
Willingness to learn our systems (wait, we have systems?)
Full-time availability–but if you have cool side projects that increase human agency, we totally want you to keep working on it...we’ll even help!
Demonstrated ability to work independently/autonomously
Ability to communicate effectively and work exclusively in English. This is a must, our ability to crack jokes in other languages is decidedly de rigeur...
BONUS POINTS FOR
Experience with self-managed data science projects–show us your cool side hustles, especially if they increase human agency or include obscure references!
Software development background - We need help with syntax in English too...
Experience building and training image classifier models–extra double-secret bonus points for identifying Schroedinger’s cat in a video
JavaScript / Node.js experience–require(‘sense of humor’)
Clean Code, Unit Tests, Lather, Rinse, Repeat
Experience managing clients and client relationships–because, y’know, they pay us...
Experience in Startups–because, y’know, we kinda are one, or actually more like several startups all rolled into one!
Equity
Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.
At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.
Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.
We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.
Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.
Salary range from $120k/year to $220k/year. Not in the range? That's fine, you can still and our team may fit you in a more senior position that we're not actively hiring right now, but we are growing fast and may have other openings soon.

711,Machine Learning Ops Engineer,Patrick J McGovern Foundation,Remote,"$108,000 - $145,000 a year","The Patrick J. McGovern Foundation (PJMF) is a private foundation dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence and data science solutions to create a thriving, equitable, and sustainable future for all. PJMF works in partnership with public, private and social institutions to drive progress on our most pressing challenges, including digital health, climate change, broad digital access, and data maturity in the social sector.

For more information, please visit our website at https://www.mcgovern.org/. Core to PJMF’s mission is inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA). We apply the IDEA framework to all we do, from growing a diverse team within the foundation to coalition building with organizations and people around the world, and to democratizing the development and rewards of AI and data.

About the Role:

PJMF’s Data Practice team connects nonprofit organizations worldwide with expert technical guidance and practical hands-on experience using advanced data approaches and tools that can simultaneously move a nonprofit forward on its data journey while unlocking new pathways to impact. The team’s approach is issue-, tech-, and region-agnostic, creating an open space for nonprofits to explore the data solutions best suited to their work, communities, and contexts – rather than limiting choices to the data solutions most accessible to them in the near term.

PJMF’s Data Practice seeks a civic-minded, socially-conscious, and industry-experienced MLOps Engineer to join its team of technical leads and program implementation specialists in supporting nonprofit grant partners as they progress their respective data journeys. Data Practice grant partnerships are high-touch engagements between nonprofit staff with varying levels of data expertise and experienced PJMF data practitioners with industry-level skill sets. Over the course of each calendar year, Data Practice operations run on two tracks: implementation of Data Practice programs with grant partners selected in the previous calendar year, and strategy development and selection of grant and implementation partners for the next calendar year. Data Practice technical and program staff collaborate closely to both select Data Practice partners and implement Data Practice programs.

In this role, you will join the team’s Data Scientist, Cloud Engineer, and Data Engineer as a Data Practice technical lead, providing a combination of ML/DevOps instruction, mentorship, and guidance to nonprofits seeking to explore the value of integrating advanced data tools and approaches into their work. The Data Practice’s MLOps Engineer will be expected to serve as a trusted advisor to individual grant partners, with a willingness to both troubleshoot acute data challenges and engage in the co-creation of solutions designed for longer-term impact.

Relationship management, facilitated by both technical leads and program implementation specialists on the Data Practice team, is critical to creating the trusted environment required to enable and document learning between the Foundation and its grant partners, and among the grant partners themselves. We seek candidates with sharp communication skills, patience, discretion, awareness of the contexts and constraints commonly experienced by nonprofits, and a commitment to knowledge capture and continuous learning. This position will report to the Director, Data Practice.
How you will make an impact:
Advise grant partners on technology selection, software architecture design, security practices, and implementation, including productionization and scalable deployment of machine learning models and data-enabled applications
Regularly learn and implement new technologies, and play an active advisory role in developing, proving out, and (re)assessing solutions under exploration by grant partners
Lead scoping exercises with prospective and current grant partners on stability, application delivery, and availability
Maintain a strong security awareness through frequent software architecture design reviews
Keep up-to-date with latest developments in machine learning and DevOps, particularly with regard to cloud services and the use of data technology by nonprofits, and share your knowledge with the Data Practice team and grant partners
Assist in evaluating the reliability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of machine learning models and work with grant partners to identify areas of improvement
Work with individual nonprofits to connect the gap from development to production for ML and natural language processing (NLP) models under the constraints of scalability, correctness, maintainability, and efficiency
Develop scripts and processes to optimize and automate ML and NLP models in production within the cloud and bring subject matter expertise about data storage and object-oriented programing
Develop strategies to track model performance and drift, identifying models that need to be retrained
What you will need to succeed:
""Data for Good"". Understanding of / interest in the use of responsible AI for international development or social/environmental impact work
Knowledge and Expertise. MLOps experience automating processes, using data to make better decisions, using software to make processes more efficient, improving the quality of the product or service provided by an organization, and improving speed of delivery
Strategic Mindset. Systems thinker capable of analyzing and distilling observations, ideas, and feedback into team notes, memos, and slide presentations
Context Awareness & Spirit of Inquiry. Familiarity with the institutions and networks most relevant to our work. Empathy for the challenges – data or otherwise – nonprofits face in delivering impact. Desire to learn together with and from, rather than preach to, partners.
Thoughtfulness. Be a thoughtful, responsible representative of the Foundation and remain mindful of power dynamics when interacting with external stakeholders. Proactively identify potential issues or roadblocks in external relationships and follow team norms when addressing them
Creativity. Ability to see an opportunity beyond the status quo and develop a roadmap to get there
Adaptability. Entrepreneurial spirit and the ability to transition between independent, project-based, and team-based work with ease from a remote location
Teamwork. Self-management skills and ability to work as part of a nimble and fast-moving team; strong multitasking and parallel development abilities
100% Remote. Desire to work remotely, but not alone - with mature, socially minded professionals
Work eligibility. Applicants must be authorized to work for any employer in the U.S. We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of an employment Visa at this time.
Tech experience you will need to succeed:
Extensive knowledge & experience with Git, Linux system administration, Kubernetes/Docker, ML data pipelines, databases (SQL, NoSQL, RDS, CloudSQL, DynamoDB, Redshift, etc.), cloud services (at least AWS and/or GCP), and distributed systems
Ability to code in multiple languages (Python and SQL; R, Java, or others as well)
Strong communication and problem-solving skills with the ability to discuss projects with colleagues who have limited knowledge of ML/DevOps techniques and tools

The foundation recognizes 11 paid national holidays per year and may also announce closure for local, regional, or state holidays
Remote Work Environment – Ability to work 100% remotely, but not alone - with mature, socially minded professionals
Wellness Support – Access to Ginger, Gympass, Headspace, and SmartSpend Plus, along with financial well-being providers

726,Machine Learning Ops Engineer,Patrick J McGovern Foundation,Remote,"$108,000 - $145,000 a year","The Patrick J. McGovern Foundation (PJMF) is a private foundation dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence and data science solutions to create a thriving, equitable, and sustainable future for all. PJMF works in partnership with public, private and social institutions to drive progress on our most pressing challenges, including digital health, climate change, broad digital access, and data maturity in the social sector.

For more information, please visit our website at https://www.mcgovern.org/. Core to PJMF’s mission is inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA). We apply the IDEA framework to all we do, from growing a diverse team within the foundation to coalition building with organizations and people around the world, and to democratizing the development and rewards of AI and data.

About the Role:

PJMF’s Data Practice team connects nonprofit organizations worldwide with expert technical guidance and practical hands-on experience using advanced data approaches and tools that can simultaneously move a nonprofit forward on its data journey while unlocking new pathways to impact. The team’s approach is issue-, tech-, and region-agnostic, creating an open space for nonprofits to explore the data solutions best suited to their work, communities, and contexts – rather than limiting choices to the data solutions most accessible to them in the near term.

PJMF’s Data Practice seeks a civic-minded, socially-conscious, and industry-experienced MLOps Engineer to join its team of technical leads and program implementation specialists in supporting nonprofit grant partners as they progress their respective data journeys. Data Practice grant partnerships are high-touch engagements between nonprofit staff with varying levels of data expertise and experienced PJMF data practitioners with industry-level skill sets. Over the course of each calendar year, Data Practice operations run on two tracks: implementation of Data Practice programs with grant partners selected in the previous calendar year, and strategy development and selection of grant and implementation partners for the next calendar year. Data Practice technical and program staff collaborate closely to both select Data Practice partners and implement Data Practice programs.

In this role, you will join the team’s Data Scientist, Cloud Engineer, and Data Engineer as a Data Practice technical lead, providing a combination of ML/DevOps instruction, mentorship, and guidance to nonprofits seeking to explore the value of integrating advanced data tools and approaches into their work. The Data Practice’s MLOps Engineer will be expected to serve as a trusted advisor to individual grant partners, with a willingness to both troubleshoot acute data challenges and engage in the co-creation of solutions designed for longer-term impact.

Relationship management, facilitated by both technical leads and program implementation specialists on the Data Practice team, is critical to creating the trusted environment required to enable and document learning between the Foundation and its grant partners, and among the grant partners themselves. We seek candidates with sharp communication skills, patience, discretion, awareness of the contexts and constraints commonly experienced by nonprofits, and a commitment to knowledge capture and continuous learning. This position will report to the Director, Data Practice.
How you will make an impact:
Advise grant partners on technology selection, software architecture design, security practices, and implementation, including productionization and scalable deployment of machine learning models and data-enabled applications
Regularly learn and implement new technologies, and play an active advisory role in developing, proving out, and (re)assessing solutions under exploration by grant partners
Lead scoping exercises with prospective and current grant partners on stability, application delivery, and availability
Maintain a strong security awareness through frequent software architecture design reviews
Keep up-to-date with latest developments in machine learning and DevOps, particularly with regard to cloud services and the use of data technology by nonprofits, and share your knowledge with the Data Practice team and grant partners
Assist in evaluating the reliability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of machine learning models and work with grant partners to identify areas of improvement
Work with individual nonprofits to connect the gap from development to production for ML and natural language processing (NLP) models under the constraints of scalability, correctness, maintainability, and efficiency
Develop scripts and processes to optimize and automate ML and NLP models in production within the cloud and bring subject matter expertise about data storage and object-oriented programing
Develop strategies to track model performance and drift, identifying models that need to be retrained
What you will need to succeed:
""Data for Good"". Understanding of / interest in the use of responsible AI for international development or social/environmental impact work
Knowledge and Expertise. MLOps experience automating processes, using data to make better decisions, using software to make processes more efficient, improving the quality of the product or service provided by an organization, and improving speed of delivery
Strategic Mindset. Systems thinker capable of analyzing and distilling observations, ideas, and feedback into team notes, memos, and slide presentations
Context Awareness & Spirit of Inquiry. Familiarity with the institutions and networks most relevant to our work. Empathy for the challenges – data or otherwise – nonprofits face in delivering impact. Desire to learn together with and from, rather than preach to, partners.
Thoughtfulness. Be a thoughtful, responsible representative of the Foundation and remain mindful of power dynamics when interacting with external stakeholders. Proactively identify potential issues or roadblocks in external relationships and follow team norms when addressing them
Creativity. Ability to see an opportunity beyond the status quo and develop a roadmap to get there
Adaptability. Entrepreneurial spirit and the ability to transition between independent, project-based, and team-based work with ease from a remote location
Teamwork. Self-management skills and ability to work as part of a nimble and fast-moving team; strong multitasking and parallel development abilities
100% Remote. Desire to work remotely, but not alone - with mature, socially minded professionals
Work eligibility. Applicants must be authorized to work for any employer in the U.S. We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of an employment Visa at this time.
Tech experience you will need to succeed:
Extensive knowledge & experience with Git, Linux system administration, Kubernetes/Docker, ML data pipelines, databases (SQL, NoSQL, RDS, CloudSQL, DynamoDB, Redshift, etc.), cloud services (at least AWS and/or GCP), and distributed systems
Ability to code in multiple languages (Python and SQL; R, Java, or others as well)
Strong communication and problem-solving skills with the ability to discuss projects with colleagues who have limited knowledge of ML/DevOps techniques and tools
Ability to oversee and provide input regarding infrastructure design and maintenance

Flexible PTO – Unlimited paid time off, which allows team members to take the time they need for vacation or illness so they can return to work able to contribute fully to our mission. The foundation recognizes 11 paid national holidays per year and may also announce closure for local, regional, or state holidays
Remote Work Environment – Ability to work 100% remotely, but not alone - with mature, socially minded professionals
Wellness Support – Access to Ginger, Gympass, Headspace, and SmartSpend Plus, along with financial well-being providers

We have built an environment that celebrates the differences in backgrounds and experiences. PJMF invests in activities that lead to greater inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility in how AI and data are conceptualized, developed, applied, and deployed.
