Department Description
The Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care at UCSF provides outstanding patient care, promotes cutting-edge basic and clinical science research, and educates the next generation of health care providers while focusing on increasing diversity, equity and inclusion across the organization.

The Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care ranks as one of the largest departments in the School of Medicine with an annual budget of $114 million. The two largest component of the annual budget are Professional Fee Income and Extramural Funds, representing over $101 million and $9.6 million of the annual budget respectively. Currently, the department has over 165 Faculty members, 25 Staff Physicians, 162 Staff Employees, 11 Fellows, 75 Residents, 21 Non-Faculty Academics, 9 Post Docs, 68 CRNAs and 5 Nurse Practitioners at ZSFG.

In addition to the Moffitt-Long Hospital, very active units of the department exist at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (inpatient and outpatient, including a very active trauma service), San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (inpatient and outpatient), Mt. Zion Medical Center (outpatient, including 23 hour stays and the Pain Management Center), the UCSF Orthopedic Institute and the Benioff Children's, Betty Irene Moore Women's and Bakar Cancer (NIH-designated Cancer Center) Hospitals in the Mission Bay neighborhood.

The Department now has essential roles in patient care outside of the operating rooms, with active participation in Ambulatory Care, Acute and Chronic Pain, and in the Preoperative Clinic. Over the department’s fifty-plus years of existence, the department has been at the heart of modern anesthesia’s explosive growth, and to this day continues to have an enormous impact on surgical practice and the management of pain. The department’s research, education, and clinical care quickly earned and have maintained reputations that are the equal or better of any institution in the world. Individual members of our faculty have had a major influence on our specialty both nationally and internationally, including NIH study sections, NIH funding, FDA and Editorial Boards. Research activities within this department are integrated with and inform clinical practice.

The Department of Anesthesia provides considerable support and structure for research in general and, for research training programs, highlighted by the innovative Pathway to Scientific Independence (PSI). This program begins at the residency level, incorporating the Research Scholars Track of the Anesthesia Residency, moving through the post-residency NIH-funded T32 training grant, and faculty positions with a mentored research support, and ultimately to achieving extramurally funded, independent researcher status.

Recently there has been renewed interest in understanding if and why pulse oximeters may perform differently in patients depending on their skin color. Our team has published some of the seminal research on this topic and is the leading lab in the world for this type of research (hypoxialab.org). In collaboration with leading regulatory agencies, we are now setting out to try to better understand and solve this problem with multiple new research initiatives.

As part of the project we will be setting up robust data collection systems in the lab and the hospital settings as well as creating and managing an open access data repository for diagnostics device data. This repository will contain data from our lab as well as data from collaborating study groups. The data will be shared via portals we will create that facilitate raw data utilization for researchers and industry, as well as visualized data to help lay persons and consumers better understand device technology performance and standards. The research data analyst will work on multiple aspects of the above work, including working closely with our laboratory based clinical research team to develop familiarity with our data collection protocols.

Department Description
The Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care at UCSF provides outstanding patient care, promotes cutting-edge basic and clinical science research, and educates the next generation of health care providers while focusing on increasing diversity, equity and inclusion across the organization.

The Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care ranks as one of the largest departments in the School of Medicine with an annual budget of $114 million. The two largest component of the annual budget are Professional Fee Income and Extramural Funds, representing over $101 million and $9.6 million of the annual budget respectively. Currently, the department has over 165 Faculty members, 25 Staff Physicians, 162 Staff Employees, 11 Fellows, 75 Residents, 21 Non-Faculty Academics, 9 Post Docs, 68 CRNAs and 5 Nurse Practitioners at ZSFG.

In addition to the Moffitt-Long Hospital, very active units of the department exist at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (inpatient and outpatient, including a very active trauma service), San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (inpatient and outpatient), Mt. Zion Medical Center (outpatient, including 23 hour stays and the Pain Management Center), the UCSF Orthopedic Institute and the Benioff Children's, Betty Irene Moore Women's and Bakar Cancer (NIH-designated Cancer Center) Hospitals in the Mission Bay neighborhood.

The Department now has essential roles in patient care outside of the operating rooms, with active participation in Ambulatory Care, Acute and Chronic Pain, and in the Preoperative Clinic. Over the department’s fifty-plus years of existence, the department has been at the heart of modern anesthesia’s explosive growth, and to this day continues to have an enormous impact on surgical practice and the management of pain. The department’s research, education, and clinical care quickly earned and have maintained reputations that are the equal or better of any institution in the world. Individual members of our faculty have had a major influence on our specialty both nationally and internationally, including NIH study sections, NIH funding, FDA and Editorial Boards. Research activities within this department are integrated with and inform clinical practice. For many years, ours has been among the top departments for NIH research funding in anesthesia in the United States.

The Department of Anesthesia provides considerable support and structure for research in general and, for research training programs, highlighted by the innovative Pathway to Scientific Independence (PSI). This program begins at the residency level, incorporating the Research Scholars Track of the Anesthesia Residency, moving through the post-residency NIH-funded T32 training grant, and faculty positions with a mentored research support, and ultimately to achieving extramurally funded, independent researcher status.

“In 2012, a lawyer, a data scientist, and a software developer walked into a startup event…”
Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.
Obtaining a U.S. patent is a springboard to innovation. But the process can be time-consuming and expensive. We aim to remove as much guesswork as possible from the patent application process. And since 2012, law firms and corporate legal teams have trusted Juristat’s data analytics and workflow automation solutions to do just that.
Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.

615,Data Conversion Analyst,Grant Street Group,Remote,N,"The first 90% of a data conversion is simple, but the remaining 10% is where the fun starts. That’s where you get to exercise your problem-solving skills. If the following describes you, you’re a perfect fit for the data conversion analyst role at Grant Street Group.
You want to work with a team of awesome project managers, business analysts, developers, and data analysts to migrate clients to our TaxSys software.

You’re an excellent communicator. Communication, both written and verbal, is what you do. You’ll work on specs for developers, documentation status updates for management, and customer communications. You know your audience, and you adapt to their needs and technical level.
